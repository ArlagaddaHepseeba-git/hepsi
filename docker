Why is Docker used?
Docker is widely used for several key reasons that streamline the software development and deployment process:
Consistency
Docker eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem by ensuring that an application and its dependencies are packaged together. This means an application will behave identically across development, testing, and production environments.
Portability
Containerized applications are highly portable and can run anywhere, including on a developer's laptop, an on-premises data center, or any major cloud platform like AWS or Microsoft Azure.
