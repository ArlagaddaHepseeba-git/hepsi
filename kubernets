The deployment, scaling, and upkeep of containerized applications are automated by the open-source container orchestration platform Kubernetes. Kubernetes, well-known for managing workloads containerized in on-premises and cloud environments, was initially created by Google and is presently managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Developers can concentrate on creating code because Kubernetes manages the intricacy of executing application delivery efficiency and dependability thanks to Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities.
